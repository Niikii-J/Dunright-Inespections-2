                                    Pre-purchase Inspections are the most common type of inspection and by far the most vital. For most people, buying a home is the largest investment of their life. As with any investment, there is a need for thorough evaluation and analysis before the final commitment. To roll the dice on the purchase of a home without a building inspectiorâ€™s evaluation of the property is gambling, not investing. Almost all buildings have defects and the excitement of owning a home can quickly diminish with unpleasant costly surprises after moving in. A professional home inspection is the best way to gain a thorough knowledge of the actual condition your prospective purchase enabling you to make a wise decision.

                                    Pre-listing Inspections provide sellers with a distinct advantage. They demonstrate you, as the seller, have nothing to hide, establishing trust among all parties and increasing the liklihood of a fast sale. If defects are uncovered, the inspection report provides the seller the option of repairing or replacing the item prior to listing their home, greatly increasing the desirability of the property and reducing negotiations on the asking price.

                                    I pay special attention to safety items, including fire hazards, health hazards, electrical shock and potential child safety issues. I crawl into attic spaces and climb up on the roof whenever possible, where most homeowners do not venture. Where I identify termite damage, water deterioration, asbestos-type material or possible roof leaks which are beyond the scope of the inspection, I recommend when necessary, further review by an appropriate expert to determine the course of action.
