                            At Damianos Sotheby’s International Realty, we consistently use Jacques Christofilis of Dunright Home & Building Inspections, for home inspections in The Commonwealth of the Bahamas. It was therefore natural that I recommended Jacques Christofilis to my customer ‘JJ’ who was looking at one of our houses. This is what ‘JJ’ had to say about his experience with Christofilis and Dunright:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “I had noticed some moisture damage in the house during our first showing. We liked the house but I needed to know how bad the home’s condition was and how much TLC was needed. Jacques Christofilis met me on-site and we spent the next few hours going over the home. The property was a townhouse and to my relief the common areas were also inspected, as this impacts the overall value of the property. J. Christofilis was very meticulous and systematically inspected every door, window, wall, ceiling, etc of the home; every faucet tap was turned and every light switch flipped, every door and window was opened and closed. Anything that was reasonably accessible was inspected. For each defect encountered, Mr. Jacques Christofilis explained the extent of the problem, and the short term/long term impact it would have on the property. The disrepair and lack of maintenance of the house was worse than we had expected but Jacques Christofilis’ many years of experience in building inspections, general construction and repair became apparent in that in many cases Jacques could suggest repair methods and could give rough “guestimates” of repair prices.
                        </p>

                        <p>                            
                            Shortly after the onsite inspection I had the report in my email; the report was clearly organized with an itemized description and findings for each part of every room. For each fault or problem the report referenced digital photos which were conveniently placed below the description to clearly illustrate the finding. The report was professionally presented, and most importantly gave me a rough idea at the end of the overall estimated cost to bring this property up to a reasonable standard. As I placed my bid on the property is was important to know if the TLC needed was going to be $10,000 or $200,000! The Dunright report helped me make good due diligence and an appropriate offer. On top of everything Jacques Christofilis has a nice personality and it was a pleasure spending several hours with him inspecting the property. I can warmly recommend Jacques Chrsitofilis and Dunright Home Inspections to anyone considering buying a house in The Bahamas.                      
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is why I will keep recommending Jacques Christofilis and Dunright home inspections to our clients.

                            Though we did not purchase the home, your report gave to us a full spectrum of the assets and liabilities of the property which then allowed us to make a risk free assessment towards our investment.
